# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

Referenced versions in headers are tagged on Github, in parentheses are for pypi.

## [vxx](https://github.com/pydicom/deid-data/tree/main) (master)
 - adding new fields to ctbrain1.dcm (Humans Dataset) for improved VR Blank testing. (0.0.18) 
 - creation of external data repository for deid (0.0.17)
